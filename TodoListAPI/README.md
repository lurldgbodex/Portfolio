# TodoListAPI
The TodoListAPI is a Django-based API application that allows users to manage their to-do lists. Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks, categorize tasks, and search for tasks based on various criteria. The application will provide secure user authentication and pagination for a smooth user experience.

## Project Objectives:
* Develop a functional and user-friendly API for managing to-do lists.
* Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure data privacy and security.
* Allow users to categorize tasks to help with organization and planning.
*  Provide search and filtering capabilities to make it easy for users to find specific tasks.
* Implement pagination to optimize API performance when retrieving task lists.
* Create clear and consistent API documentation for ease of use.
