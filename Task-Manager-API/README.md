# Task Manager API
The Task Manager API is a RESTful API that allows users to manage their tasks. Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks. Each task has a title, description, and status (e.g., "completed," "in progress," or "pending"). The API also supports user authentication, allowing users to register, login, and manage their own tasks.
